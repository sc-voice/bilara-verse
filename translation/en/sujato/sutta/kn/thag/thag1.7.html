“Yopānudī maccurājassa senaṁ,<br/>
Naḷasetuṁva sudubbalaṁ mahogho;<br/>
Vijitāvī apetabheravo hi,<br/>
Danto so parinibbuto ṭhitatto”ti.<br/>
Itthaṁ sudaṁ āyasmā bhalliyo thero gāthaṁ abhāsitthāti.

He has swept away the army of the King of Death,<br/>
as a great flood, a fragile bridge of reeds.<br/>
Victorious since his fears have vanished:<br/>
tame and steadfast, he has become extinguished.<br/>
It was thus that this verse was recited by the senior venerable Bhalliya.
